            <h1>THE WORLD OF SKILLS</h1>
            <h3 >It's time to update our brain</h3>
            <p>TWOSS is the company that wants to change the full education system from a traditional way of study to skilled based education. Our simple goal is to make 18 year old teenagers capable enough to become financially independent with the help of their personalised and groomed skills and give them a proper platform to showcase their skills A platform where they can make money with their skills and knowledge.</p>
            <p>Right now our biggest issue is not that we don't have jobs, the biggest issue is we don't have proper updated required skills . because our Indian education system is not updated and due to this in spite of investing too much money and time on studies students are not able to get a proper job at the age of 25 according to their qualifications. In India those who have completed their education with proper guidance and with good mentors they start running abroad for better opportunities...</p>
            <p>The world is updating rapidly, and if we want to grow then we need to add up more skills starting from our school days and for that  parent and students will never say NO. Everyone wants money and a better life for them and for their family . In fact, 99% of people who are studying in school or college their goal is to earn money and become successful people and because of this we will be the world best skilled champion company in this world!!</p>
